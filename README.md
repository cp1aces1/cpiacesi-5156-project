# cpiacesi-5156-project
This project folder contains 3 jupyter notebooks that make up the work I did for my UNC Charlotte ITCS 5156 Applied Machine Learning class final project.

The core of the work consisited of replicating the models described in three papers for applying Machine Learning to the challenge of 
predicting credit card fraud.

The jupyter notebooks contained here:
1. Credit Fraud Syn Dataset:  This notebook implements the models described in the three papers listed below using data set 1.
2. Project Dataset IEEE:  This notebook implements the models described in the three papers listed below using data set 2.
3. Project Dataset IEEEE-Deep learning:  This nootebook is the start of future work on the topic.  Includes first attempt at model in Esenogho et al.


The datasets used for training and evaluating the models were too large for upload.  Links to the datasets:
